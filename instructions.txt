Just so you know, I don't have any ATOM, so I couldn't test this.

Instructions:
1. put gaiad.exe and infinitesend.bat in the same folder
2. open a cmd window
3. cd to the folder that has gaiad.exe and infinitesend.bat
4. type "gaiad keys add redfox --recover"   You can change redfox to whatever alias you want
5. enter your mnemonic when it asks for it
6. using notepad, change the line in infinitesend that starts with "gaiad" to use the alias you picked 
   (or keep "redfox", if that's what you typed for the "keys add" command), change the cosmos address you want to send 
   to, and the amount in uatom you want to send.  
   Send 10000uatom less then what is unbonding, because that is how much gas it will cost.
   If someone gives you access to a different node that doesn't get as much traffic as the rpc.cosmos.network node,
   you can change that too.
7. When you save the file make sure it still has the .bat extension.  You might have to change your file explorer
   settings to show file extensions if you don't see them.
8. Move all your ATOM out of the account before you run the script.
9. Sometime very close to when it will unbond, run the script by typing "infinitesend.bat" in the cmd window (make
   sure you cd into the folder that has infinitesend.bat, and make sure gaiad.exe is in the same location)
10. You can stop the script by pressing CTRL-C in the same cmd window you started it.  Might be a good idea to run it
   as soon as you set up your alias and change the file to make sure it runs, and after you stop it, scroll up to 
   see that it says that you ran out of gas (or something similar)
